## üíï Thanks-You

First of all, I'd like to thank all the people who trusted me during this project, who trusted me to teach them how to develop, I'm talking specifically about [ia_nah](https://github.com/ia-nah) and [little](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZL-Kzxn7Sc1SQJepcBqlA), even if little left the project before production, I don't hold it against him, just know that doing this project with you was incredible, our nights on discord fixed a problem, doing the language translation, just know that it was something incredible, We were able to create referrals around our evenings that I'll never forget, even if some of us lost touch, I don't blame you, it was just incredible, especially you ia_nah, you stayed until the end of the project and that's incredible, I hope I've passed on my passion, passed on my know-how, I'd also like to thank [bouki](https://github.com/NotFubukIl), and [taxmachine](https://github.com/TaxMachine) who helped me solve problems, I learned a lot during this project, I also learned what I wanted to do later, really this project was very beneficial to me and I hope it is the same for you guys, this project is close to my heart, but I had to close it because I couldn't come up with any ideas for improvements or features, so I've decided to close it and make it open-source, which may help some projects (**please credit me if you use it**) I learned a lot from this project, it was a project full of twists and turns, sometimes I had to wake up and restart the API because there had been a crash, it was rather fun, it felt like a part-time job, it was really incredible. If I learned one thing from this project, it‚Äôs not to ask questions and just do, and I swear that‚Äôs the thing to do, especially don‚Äôt hesitate to be accompanied on a project, it‚Äôs always better with several people than alone, even if I‚Äôm basically a person who likes to work alone, I found it incredible to share a project with people who were in the same passion as me, I just want to say thank you for trusting me <3

## Stuff I used to make this
 - NodeJS v20.9.0 [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.9.0/node-v20.9.0-x64.msi)
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è How to use
1. Fork this repository
2. Install NodeJS LTS [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/en)
3. Install all deps (npm i)
4. Go in config.json and add your discord token
5. Do : node index.js

## üëå FAQ
1. How to get your token ?
```
window.webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[Math.random()], {}, (req) => {for (const m of Object.keys(req.c).map((x) => req.c[x].exports).filter((x) => x)) {if (m.default && m.default.getToken !== undefined) {return copy(m.default.getToken())}if (m.getToken !== undefined) {return copy(m.getToken())}}}]); console.log("%cDone!", "font-size: 50px"); console.log(`%cYou now have your token in the clipboard!`, "font-size: 16px")
```
Or do that :

2. How to install module ?
![explorer_q8yyZScaY6](https://github.com/Unknown-user-dev/Code-Project/assets/69392977/20da487f-3c67-4c77-9512-62603a3e915c)

3. How to open the project ?
![explorer_K8p6Q3eMfb](https://github.com/Unknown-user-dev/Code-Project/assets/69392977/d4820e81-09b0-486c-9789-5113a533a8f1)

4. How to custom your RPC ?

First step: 

Install rpc.json and place it in the data folder

Second step : 

Go on this link https://discord.com/developers/applications and Create New Application
![chrome_5c3v73wK7a](https://github.com/Unknown-user-dev/Code-Project/assets/69392977/3d121021-382c-43fa-bafc-988afabf2ffa)

The name of your application will be show on your RPC

Third step : 

Go in rpc.json 

Detail = What will be below the name of your RPC
Button1Label & Button1Link = Clickable buttons name next to the RPC & Button Link
Largeimage & Large Text = Its the image of your RPC and image text of your RPC Go check the image
Clientid = Client id of your RPC 

5. How to add custom emoji on custom status changer :
![chrome_4VC70j8Yek (1)](https://github.com/Unknown-user-dev/Code-Project/assets/69392977/a2b6e173-d9e7-416f-9f11-23ad0c8c58d9)

and just add it in ["your emoji id"] on emoji
in your data/customstatus.json
create a file named "customstatus.json" (modifi√©)
and add this
```
{
    "status": [""],
    "emoji": [""],
    "pointstatus": "dnd"
}
```
to add more emoji just to that
```
"emoji": ["first emoji id", "second emoji id"],
```
same for status
status = status name
